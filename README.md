 Text2SQL using LlamaIndex and Ollama

If your queries need to **combine data from different schemas**, you can modify the setup to support **multi-schema queries** by either:

1. **Merging Contexts from Multiple Indices**: Retrieve relevant context from multiple schema indices, combine them, and then pass the combined context to the LLM for SQL generation.
   
2. **Creating a Unified Virtual Schema**: Optionally, you can create a meta-index that consolidates information from multiple schemas, but this approach may lose schema-specific granularity.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement **multi-schema queries** while preserving flexibility:

---

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Understanding Relationships**:
   - Ensure the metadata includes relationships or keys to join tables across schemas (e.g., foreign keys).
   
2. **Selective Retrieval**:
   - Use a query preprocessor to determine which schemas are relevant to the query.

3. **Dynamic Context Building**:
   - Retrieve context from all relevant schemas.
   - Combine contexts intelligently to avoid information overload.

### **Modified Implementation for Multi-Schema Queries**

### **Key Features of This Implementation**

1. **Schema-Specific Context Retrieval**:
   - The `_retrieve_contexts` method pulls relevant context from all specified schema indices.
   - Combines contexts into a single input for the LLM, with schema names clearly marked.

2. **Dynamic Schema Selection**:
   - The user specifies which schemas are relevant for a query (`schema_names`).
   - Warning messages notify if a schema is not found.

3. **Prompt Clarity**:
   - The combined context is structured to include schema names, ensuring the LLM understands the origin of each piece of information.

4. **Multi-Schema SQL Generation**:
   - The `_generate_sql` method creates an SQL query that can span multiple schemas based on the combined context.

---

### **Future Extensions**

1. **Automatic Schema Detection**:
   - Use a schema discovery mechanism (e.g., NLP preprocessing of the query) to infer which schemas are relevant automatically.

2. **Join Optimization**:
   - Incorporate schema relationships or constraints (e.g., primary/foreign keys) to guide join operations intelligently.

3. **Cross-Schema Meta Index**:
   - Create a meta index to precompute relationships and optimize cross-schema queries.

This approach maintains modularity while enabling multi-schema query capabilities. ðŸš€
